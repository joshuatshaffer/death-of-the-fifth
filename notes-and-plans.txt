The game will be a maze escape game.
Instead of useing walls to hinder movement the maze will be very open, however, the rooms will be conected in a non-euclidien maner.
Navigating this mangeld space will be the center piece of game play.

multilevel clique combiner

First a multiset of room specs is made.
  - Room specs contain info describing the room and how many doors it has but not what it is connected to.
  - This multiset of room specs alows us to controll how many of each kind of room there will be and to have unique "land mark" rooms.
Then a maze builder is called with the room specs.
  - This maze builder is recursive.
  - split up the room specs and use them to make cliques
  - conect these cliques together to make a compound clique
  - return the resulting compound clique
when the top level clique is done convert it to tyed knot form
